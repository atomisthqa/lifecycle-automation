[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atomist/lifecycle-automation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atomist/lifecycle-automation)
  
This project contains lifecycle automations that create beautiful,
correlated, and actionable [Slack][slack] messages for issues,
pull requests, pushes, builds, and deployments using
the [`@atomist/automation-client`][client] node module to implement a
client that connects to the [Atomist][atomist] API.

[client]: https://github.com/atomist/automation-client-ts (@atomist/automation-client Node Module)

This Atomist API client can provide your team with better Slack messages about what is
happening in your development and delivery lifecycle by
simply adding the Atomist Bot to your Slack team:

 </a>
</p>

Once the Atomist Bot is in your Slack team, invite it to a channel
where you discuss a repository and link the channel to the repository
using the `repo` command

```
/invite @atomist
@atomist repo owner=ORG repo=REPO
```

replacing `ORG` with your GitHub.com organization and `REPO` with the
name of the repo you want to link.  Simply repeat for all the repos
and channels you want to link!

## Development

You will need to have [Node.js][node] installed.  To verify that the
right versions are installed, please run:

```
$ node -v
v8.4.0
$ npm -v
5.4.1
```

[node]: https://nodejs.org/ (Node.js)

### Build and Test

Command | Reason
------- | ------
`npm install` | to install all the required packages
`npm run build` | lint, compile, and test
`npm start` | to start the Atomist automation client
`npm run autostart` | run the client, refreshing when files change
`npm run lint` | to run tslint against the TypeScript
`npm run compile` | to compile all TypeScript into JavaScript
`npm test` | to run tests and ensure everything is working
`npm run autotest` | run tests continuously
`npm run clean` | remove stray compiled JavaScript files and build directory

### Release

To create a new release of the project, simply push a tag of the form
`M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the next
appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  The version in
the package.json is replaced by the build and is totally ignored!  For
example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```
$ git tag -a 1.2.3
$ git push --tags
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will publish
the NPM module and automatically create a GitHub release using the tag
name for the release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as
the contents of the release notes.
